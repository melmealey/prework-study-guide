# Bootcamp Prework Study Guide Webpage

## A study guide for course pre-work

This Prework Study Guide Webpage was a hands-on approach to learning. As one goes through the modules learning about HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript a webpage is put together 1 step at a time, looking better as more information is learned.

## Usage 
In order to keep track of this new language I am learning. a website was a great way to stay orgainzed. I was able to add to my notes in each of the sections (HTML, CSS, GIT, and JavaScript) as my knowledge expanded. This webpage will help me as I study and improve on my web development skills.
I really liked seeing the DevTools console application. 

write a short paragraph about how this Prework Study Guide can be used. For example, you can write about how each section contains notes about a certain topic, like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git. And if we open the DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first. For now, we don't need to add an image, so you can delete that part.
